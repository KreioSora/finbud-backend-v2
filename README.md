# :money_with_wings: FinBud (backend)

Created By: Samuel Ludwig Ian Samosir
## :thought_balloon: About the project
The target of this project is to create a personal finance tracker website/application that you can access anytime anywhere (with internet access, for now). This project was started because the creator felt that tracking income and expenses through excel and google spreadsheet is time consuming, and other "available" applications only have basic features despite the fact that they are asking for subscription services.

Even though this project is intended for personal uses, which would only be provided for friends and family, the development of this application will be done as if the project is for a small company with a maximum of 100 users (for now).

## :computer: Features
There are several core features that will be available on launch day, which are,
- User accounts
- Savings account

- (TBD) Investment accounts
